About LConf
===========

NETWAYS LConf is a LDAP based configuration tool for Icinga
and Nagios. All configuration elements are stored on a LDAP
server and exported to text-based configuration files.
Icinga / Nagios uses only these config files and will work
independent from the LDAP during runtime.

For detailed information about installation, legal and all
other, please take a look into ./doc

http://www.netways.org
